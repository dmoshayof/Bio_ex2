# Graph Coloring with Genteic Algorithm
4 colors graph coloring problem solved by genetic algorithm with the following parameters:
- population - number of initial solution option 
- 'mutation_probability'- the probability to have a mutation on specific gen
- 'crossover_probability- the probability to have crossover between two genes
- num of vertex- how many nodes in the graph

Solving graph according to adjacency matrix as input. Coloring only specific map ![map]('map.PNG')
